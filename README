minidjvu-mod is a multipage DjVu encoder and single page encoder/decoder.
No colors or grayscales - just black and white.

Besides DjVu, minidjvu-mod understands PBM, Windows BMP and TIFF (through libtiff).


For a quick start, see tifftodjvu.html.
That javascripted page shows samples of encoding TIFFs to DjVu.


minidjvu-mod is derived from DjVuLibre, the primary DjVu support library.
DjVuLibre may be found at

Enjoy!
